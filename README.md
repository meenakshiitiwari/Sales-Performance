# Sales-Performance
This project is a Sales Performance Analysis built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to understand how well a business is performing by looking at its sales data.
We worked with a retail sales dataset that includes:
Monthly and Quarterly Sales
Regions where sales were made
Products being sold
Salespeople who made the sales
