# Sales-Performance
This project explores sales data to understand how a business is performing â€” when sales are high or low, which regions or products are doing well, and who the top-performing salespeople are.

We used Python and Jupyter Notebook to clean the data, analyze it, and create simple charts that anyone can understand.

We worked with a retail sales dataset that includes:

Monthly and Quarterly Sales

Regions where sales were made

Products being sold

Salespeople who made the sales

The dataset used in this project is a structured retail sales dataset. It contains information about sales made over different months and quarters, across various regions. Each entry includes details such as the month of the sale, the quarter it falls in, the region where the sale happened (like North, South, East, or West), the name of the product sold, the total sales amount, and the salesperson responsible for that sale. This type of data is similar to what businesses use to track their performance over time and across different teams and locations. It provides a solid foundation for analyzing trends, comparing performance, and drawing insights that are useful for decision-making.
