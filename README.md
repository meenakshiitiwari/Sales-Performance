This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a sales dataset. The goal is to derive meaningful insights related to sales, profit, regional performance, product contribution, and sales trends over time. These insights can help businesses make informed, data-driven decisions.

**what is our Objectives**
Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and duplicates.

Perform in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends.

Visualize key metrics like total sales, regional contribution, product performance, and time-based trends.

Present business-critical insights through easy-to-understand charts and heatmaps.

**About the Dataset**
The dataset used in this project gives a complete view of retail sales. It includes:

Order Details: Information about when and where each order was placed. It has columns for Month, Quarter, and Region, which help track sales over time and across locations.

Sales Metrics: This contains the sales numbers, showing how much revenue was generated. It helps us identify trends, peaks, and low-performing periods.

Team Performance: Data on individual salespeople, allowing us to see how each team member performed and contributed to the overall sales.

Product Information: Details of the products sold, including product names and categories. This helps in analyzing which product types sell more and bring in more revenue.
